## What is Semantic HTML?

**Semantic HTML** means using HTML elements that clearly describe the **meaning and purpose** of the content they contain.

Instead of using generic tags like `<div>` and `<span>` for everything, semantic elements tell the browser and developers **what the content represents**.

In simple words:

> Semantic HTML = Meaningful HTML.

## Examples of Semantic Elements

| Tag         | Meaning                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `<header>`  | Header section of a page or section |
| `<nav>`     | Navigation links                    |
| `<main>`    | Main content                        |
| `<section>` | Section of content                  |
| `<article>` | Independent content (blog, news)    |
| `<footer>`  | Footer                              |
| `<aside>`   | Sidebar                             |
| `<button>`  | Clickable button                    |
| `<form>`    | User input form                     |

## Example: Non-Semantic vs Semantic

### ❌ Non-Semantic

```html
<div class="header">My Website</div>
<div class="menu">Home About Contact</div>
<div class="content">Welcome to my site</div>
<div class="footer">Copyright</div>
```

### ✅ Semantic

```html
<header>My Website</header>

<nav>
  Home About Contact
</nav>

<main>
  <section>
    Welcome to my site
  </section>
</main>

<footer>
  Copyright
</footer>
```
