Ahh 👍 you’re asking the meaning of this selector:

```css
.modal-container.show { }
```

Let’s break it down clearly.

---

# ✅ Meaning of `.modal-container.show`

This is called a **combined class selector**.

It means:

> Select an element that has **BOTH classes**
> `modal-container` **and** `show`

---

# 🧠 Example HTML

```html
<div class="modal-container show"></div>
```

This element has two classes:

```
modal-container
show
```

So CSS applies:

```css
.modal-container.show { }
```

---

# ❗ Important Difference

### With space ❌

```css
.modal-container .show
```

Means:

> `.show` INSIDE `.modal-container` (child element)

Example:

```html
<div class="modal-container">
    <div class="show"></div>
</div>
```

---

### Without space ✅

```css
.modal-container.show
```

Means:

> Same element has both classes

---

# ✅ Why We Use This in Modals

Default state:

```html
<div class="modal-container"></div>
```

Hidden.

When JS runs:

```js
modal.classList.add("show");
```

HTML becomes:

```html
<div class="modal-container show"></div>
```

Now CSS rule activates:

```css
.modal-container.show {
    opacity: 1;
}
```

Modal becomes visible 🎉

---

# ⭐ Real-World Concept

This is called **state-based styling**.

```
component + state
```

Examples:

```css
.button.active
.input.error
.card.selected
.menu.open
.modal.show
```

Very common in modern frontend.

---

# ✅ Simple Analogy

Think like:

```
Person.teacher
```

Means:

> Person who is also a teacher

---

# 🚀 Summary

```
.modal-container.show
```

Means:

👉 Element has BOTH classes
👉 Used to change state (hidden → visible)
👉 Triggered by JavaScript

If you want, I can explain next:

✅ Difference between class vs id selectors
✅ How classList.add/remove works internally
✅ CSS specificity (important for interviews)

Just tell me 👍
